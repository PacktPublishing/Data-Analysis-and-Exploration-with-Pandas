## About the Video Course
Are you looking for a gigantic boost in your productivity? Are you searching for some interesting and fun tricks to solve your data problems? If so, then this course is indeed a perfect choice for you. This course provides you with unique, idiomatic, and amazing solutions for both fundamental and advanced data manipulation tasks with pandas. Some solutions focus on achieving a deeper understanding of basic principles, or comparing and contrasting two similar operations. A few others will delve into a particular dataset, and let you uncover new and unexpected insights along the way. 

The pandas library is massive, and it's common for frequent users to be unaware of many of its more impressive features. The official pandas documentation, while thorough, does not contain many useful examples of how to piece together multiple commands as one would do during an actual analysis. This course guides you, as if you were looking over the shoulder of an expert, through practical situations that you are highly likely to encounter. Many advanced solutions combine several different features across the pandas library to generate results.
